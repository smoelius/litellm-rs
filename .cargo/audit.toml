# Ignore the RSA Marvin Attack vulnerability in sqlx-mysql
# This is a false positive as we don't use MySQL features and the dependency
# only appears in Cargo.lock but not in the actual build tree.
# See: https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/discussions/2172
# The vulnerability cannot be fixed until sqlx updates their RSA dependency.
